It works by creating an electric field inside the cage that is opposite in direction to the external electric field. This opposing field cancels out the external field, keeping it from penetrating the cage.\n\nGauss's law states that the electric flux through a closed surface is directly proportional to the charge enclosed within that surface.

The film is based on the novel of the same name written by James Cameron and the story is set in the future where the world's resources have been depleted and the human race is threatened by an alien race known as the Na'vi.\n\nThe film follows the story of a Na'vi warrior named Jake, who is selected to join a group of explorers on a journey to the far reaches of the planet Pandora to find a new home for humanity. Along the way, Jake and the other explorers encounter a variety of alien creatures and face a number of challenges, including the risk of being captured by the Na'vi.\n\nAs Jake and the group delve deeper into Pandora, they begin to uncover the true nature of the Na'vi and the threat they pose to humanity. The film's themes include environmentalism, spirituality, and the power of technology to shape our world.\n\nOverall, Avatar is a visually stunning and thought-provoking film that explores universal themes of survival, connection, and the human drive to explore and discover.", "a": "Avatars are a long-standing concept in popular culture, and the idea of a “second world” is central to James Cameron's movie, “Avatar”.  The concept of an Avatar refers to a fictional society where humans live in harmony with giant, sentient alien creatures called Ava.  The movie explores the concept of the Avatars through the adventures of Jake Sully and his friends James Cameron and Ellen pa.  The Avatars are thought to be the result of parallel evolution of humans and Ava, and Jake Sully becomes a warrior for the Avatars after his father’s death.  The concept of an Avatar is presented as a positive fantasy, a way for humans to coexist with Ava, and a way to explore the fantasy of the Avatars.", "judge": "model_b", "index": 179}

In Rust, monads are implemented using the `` std::rc::Rc `` type and the `` std::rc::Ref `` type.\n\nWhen you use a monad in Rust, you are essentially declaring that the type is a wrapper for a value that has an effect. For example, the `` String `` type in Rust is a monad for strings that have an effect of I/O, because it requires a file or a string slice to be created before it can be used. The `` String::new `` function takes a string slice as an argument and returns a new `` String ``.\n\nMonads provide a way to write functions that can handle computations with effects, such as input/output or exception handling, in a simple and composable way. Here's an example of a simple monad for IO in Rust:\n\n\n```rust\nfn io(value: &mut String) -> String {\n    value.push(\"IO effect\")\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let value = String::new(\"Hello, world!\");\n    io(&value); // Write \"Hello, world!IO effect\"\n    println!(\"{}\", value); // Output: Hello, world!IO effect\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the `` io `` function takes a string slice as an argument and returns a new string with an \"IO effect\" written to it. The `` main `` function creates a new string and calls the `` io `` function on it, which modifies the string in place and adds the \"IO effect\" to it.\n\nMonads are often used in Rust to model computations with effects, such as input/output or exception handling, in a simple and composable way. Here's an example of a monad for exception handling:\n\n\n```rust\nfn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -> Result<i32, std::error::Error> {\n    if b == 0 {\n        std::error::Error::new(std::error::ErrorKind::Zero, \"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    } else {\n        i32::from(a) / i32::from(b)\n    }", "b": "Monads are a type of object in functional programming that define a way to express mathematical operations in a way that is complementary to other types of objects.

For example, you could define a monad for a set of integers in Rust using the`a`monad, which is a type that represents an integer and can be used to perform a rithmetic operations on it.\nIn addition to being a powerful tool for working with complex mathematical operations, monads can also be used to create more readable and concise code. For example, you could define a monad for a set of functions, and define a function that takes in the monad as an argument, and then returns the monad as a result.\nOverall, monads are a powerful tool for creating functional programming systems that are easier to understand and maintain, as they provide a way to express complex mathematical operations in a way that is more expressive and", "judge": "tie", "index": 258}

This network would allow local governments to cooperate on issues of common interest, such as education, healthcare, and transportation.\n\nDendritic democracy has several advantages over other models of government. First, it is more efficient than centralized government. In a centralized government, all decisions have to be made by a small group of people in the capital city. This can be slow and cumbersome, especially when dealing with complex issues. In a dendritic democracy, decisions can be made at the local level, where they are most familiar with the issues.\n\nSecond, dendritic democracy is more responsive to the needs of the people. In a centralized government, it can be difficult for the people to make their voices heard. The government may be far away, and the people may not feel that they have any influence over the decisions that are made. In a dendritic democracy, the people can participate in local government directly. They can vote on local issues, and they can hold their elected officials accountable.\n\nThird, dendritic democracy is more likely to lead to consensus. In a centralized government, the majority often rules over the minority. This can lead to conflict and division.

Each individual or unit has the ability to contribute to the decision-making process and has an equal voice in the outcome. This type of democracy is designed to encourage collaboration and consensus-building, and to avoid the dominance of a single individual or group.\n\nThe concept of dendritic democracy has been applied in various contexts, including in organizational structures and political systems. For example, some political theorists have proposed that a dendritic democracy could be achieved through the use of digital technologies that allow for direct, participatory democracy.

Overall, the bottom of the Mariana Trench is a mysterious and ominous place, surrounded by the deepest and darkest waters of the ocean.", "a": "The bottom of the Mariana Trench is not visible to the naked eye. It is a deep geological feature that is located in the western Atlantic ocean off the coast of Brazil. It was formed by erosion of the shallow seafloor during the last ice age, which began about 40 million years ago. The trench measures approximately 100 meters (330 feet) long and it is made up of layers of sedimentary rock and mud, with a layer of freshwater sediments on top.\nThe bottom of the Mariana Trench is covered in a layer of limestone and dolomite, which were deposited when the seafloor cooled after the last ice age. These layers are much thicker than those found above the deep waters, making the trench a burial site for marine life. In addition to the limestone and dolomite layers, the trench also contains sand, silt, and other organic matter, which help to stabilize the environment and maintain its structure.\nOverall, the bottom of the Mariana Trench is a fascinating natural wonder that continues to be studied and researched by scientists and stakeholders today.", "judge": "model_a", "index": 353}

Increased security requirements: If your organization requires additional security measures, such as encryption or access controls, this can increase spending on AWS.\n\nIt's important to regularly review your AWS spending and make adjustments as needed to ensure that you are staying within your budget. This may involve adjusting your usage patterns, optimizing your usage of AWS services, or negotiating with AWS to get better pricing.", "judge": "tie", "index": 375}

The goal of filter topology is to achieve a particular property, such as stability or gain, among other things. \n\nOne of the most common filter topologies is the positive feedback loop, in which the output of a filter is used to feedback back into the input of the next stage. This can provide stability and gain control, but it can also cause the filter to overreact to small changes in the input signal.\n\nAnother commonly used filter topology is the negative feedback loop, in which the input of a filter is used to feedback back into the output of the next stage. This can provide stability and gain control, but it can also cause the filter to overreact to small changes in the input signal.\n\nIn general, filter topology is an important concept in the field of digital signal processing, and it helps to determine the appropriate design of filter networks for different applications.", "judge": "model_a", "index": 391}

They use the technology they have developed to make a new vehicle that will allow them to travel fast through the storm. They also try to repair the ship but it breaks down shortly after leaving. After much effort, the team manages to survive the storm and arrive safely at their destination. The final scene of \"Interstellar\" shows the crew landing on their new vessel and finally reaching their destination. Dr. Higgs looks on from his room, not knowing what lies ahead of them. He says, \"I'm going to die here.\"\nThe crew then wakes up and realizes that they are now in a dream, the only one left in", "judge": "model_b", "index": 487}

The bounding box regression layer produces a set of predicted bounding boxes and the corresponding class probabilities for each object in the image.\nYOLOv5 uses a technique called \"RoI pooling\" to produce bounding boxes for objects. RoI pooling is a technique that divides the input image into a set of equally-sized regions and predicts bounding boxes for each region.

He is a melee AD carry with strong farming potential, but he can also be difficult to master due to his high skill cap. The following tips can help you improve your Master Yi play in Wild Rift:\n\n1. Farm well: Master Yi relies on his farm to provide the gold and experience he needs to scale into a late-game threat. Use your abilities, such as \"Rapid Fire\" and \"The Ultimate Price\", to secure farm and avoid missing out on minion waves.\n\n2. Positioning: Master Yi's abilities allow him to control the battlefield and control his enemies' movements. Use \"Rapid Fire\" to control space and force your enemies to move away from objectives. \"The Ultimate Price\" can be used to secure objectives or to chase down enemies who are trying to retreat.\n\n3.

Use this to your advantage by roaming the map and looking for opportunities to gank your opponents.\n\n4. Objectives: Master Yi is a strong teamfighting presence, but he also excels at securing objectives. Use \"The Ultimate Price\" to capture dragons and \"Rapid Fire\" to secure baron Nashor.\n\n5. Last hits: Master Yi's survivability is not his strong suit, so it's important to prioritize last hitting over farming minions. Use your abilities, such as \"Rapid Fire\" and \"The Ultimate Price\", to secure last hits and deny them to your opponents.\n\n6. Play aggressively: Master Yi is a strong initiation threat, so don't be afraid to dive into the enemy team and start the fight. Use your abilities to control the battlefield and to secure kills for your team.\n\n7.

You should also try to get as much gold as possible, as this will allow you to purchase powerful items and abilities that will help you dominate the map.\n\nOverall, the key to playing Master Yi in Wild Rift is to be aggressive and opportunistic. Look for ways to pick off your opponents one by one, and don't be afraid to take risks and try new strategies. With the right mindset and a bit of practice, you can become a formidable opponent in Wild Rift as Master Yi.", "a": "Master Yi is a popular champion in League of Legends, especially in Wild Rift. He is a melee AD carry with strong farming potential, but he can also be difficult to master due to his high skill cap. The following tips can help you improve your Master Yi play in Wild Rift:\n\n1. Farm well: Master Yi relies on his farm to provide the gold and experience he needs to scale into a late-game threat. Use your abilities, such as \"Rapid Fire\" and \"The Ultimate Price\", to secure farm and avoid missing out on minion waves.\n\n2. Positioning: Master Yi's abilities allow him to control the battlefield and control his enemies' movements. Use \"Rapid Fire\" to control space and force your enemies to move away from objectives. \"The Ultimate Price\" can be used to secure objectives or to chase down enemies who are trying to retreat.\n\n3. Roam and gank: Master Yi is a strong ganker and roamer, thanks to his high mobility and his ability to quickly close the gap between him and his targets. Use this to your advantage by roaming the map and looking for opportunities to gank your opponents.\n\n4. Objectives: Master Yi is a strong teamfighting presence, but he also excels at securing objectives. Use \"The Ultimate Price\" to capture dragons and \"Rapid Fire\" to secure baron Nashor.\n\n5. Last hits: Master Yi's survivability is not his strong suit, so it's important to prioritize last hitting over farming minions. Use your abilities, such as \"Rapid Fire\" and \"The Ultimate Price\", to secure last hits and deny them to your opponents.\n\n6. Play aggressively: Master Yi is a strong initiation threat, so don't be afraid to dive into the enemy team and start the fight. Use your abilities to control the battlefield and to secure kills for your team.\n\n7. The \"Rapid Fire\" and \"The Ultimate Price\" combo: Master Yi's core combo is \"Rapid Fire\" followed by \"The Ultimate Price\". Use this combo to control the battlefield, secure kills, and escape dangerous situations.", "judge": "tie", "index": 573}
